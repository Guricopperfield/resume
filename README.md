## About me
I'm 13 years old software engineer from Tbilisi,Georgia. I started programming at the age of 9,and I really got great experience and met new people. When i'm not busy,I always attend lectures and tech talks,because I want to learn new things of all areas in technologies. I'm good at system programming,but I really,really don't like sport(competetive) programming. I have knowledge and 3 years experience of programming language C++. I also know basic C# and basics of Android Development,too. I know git at medium level.(I'm learning it now) I have a small experience of web technologies,like web engines or HTML,CSS.

## Hackathons' experience
I love hackathons more than anything in the world. It's "competition" which helps you to meet new people and learn new,great things. And of course I learned lot of things there. I attended [hack@MACS](http://hackatmacs.devpost.com/) and participated in [hack@Tbilisi](http://hacktbilisi.devpost.com/) and [hack@TSU](http://hacktsu.devpost.com). Me and my developers group created [cnNET](http://challengepost.com/software/cnnet) on hack@Tbilisi and created [AreYouAlive](http://devpost.com/software/areyoualive) on hack@TSU and we became one of the winners(AreYouAlive became uniHack's favourite project).

## Education
Due to my age,I'm school student and I'm in the eighth form. I study at Komarovi N199 public mathematical school. Before Komarovi,I studied at Tbilisi's N51 public school.

Also I'm student of Information Technology Center named [Mziuri](http://mziuri.ge/).
