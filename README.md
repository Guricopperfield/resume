## About me
I'm 14 years old software engineer from Tbilisi,Georgia. I started programming at the age of 9, and I really got great experience and met new people. When I'm not busy, I always attend lectures and tech talks, because I want to learn new things of all areas in technologies. Here's my experience and knowledge so far:

* Pascal - tiny experience. Just basics.

* [C++](https://github.com/getsadzeg/cpp-codes) - 3 years experience. Created some small projects.

* C# - small experience. Created [cnNET](https://github.com/getsadzeg/cnNET) with it.

* [Python](https://github.com/getsadzeg/python-codes) - I started learning python last winter, but umm.. Well I'm still big fan of semicolons. I don't need python very much at this time so I have no actual experience with it.

* [Java](https://github.com/getsadzeg/java-codes) - I collected much experience in last two years, created some small projects. Such as [transport](https://github.com/getsadzeg/transport) and [gegram-class](https://github.com/getsadzeg/gegram-class), also [list-class](https://github.com/getsadzeg/list-class).

* Android - My favourite thing. Created two projects on hackathons. [AreYouAlive](https://github.com/getsadzeg/AreYouAlive) and [mtredi](https://github.com/getsadzeg/mtredi).

* Git - Using and learning simply everyday, after 2014.

* Back-End Development - [Learning PHP](https://github.com/getsadzeg/php-codes) and small experience of creating back-ends such as [survey-back](https://github.com/getsadzeg/survey-back).
* Front-End Development - no actual experience. I have knowledge of very very basic HTML & CSS.

## Hackathons' experience
I love hackathons more than anything in the world. It's "competition" where you get fresh experience. Here's mine:

* [hack@MACS](http://hackatmacs.devpost.com/) - just attended.

* [hack@Tbilisi](http://hacktbilisi.devpost.com/) - created [cnNET](https://github.com/getsadzeg/cnNET).

* [hackTSU](http://hacktsu.devpost.com/) - created Android project [AreYouAlive](https://github.com/getsadzeg/AreYouAlive) and won.

* [hackTBILISI Fall](http://hacktbilisi2015.devpost.com/) - created Android project [mtredi](https://github.com/getsadzeg/mtredi) and won.

## Lapptech(2016)
I was originally recruited by [vardidzel](https://github.com/vardidzel) to work for Lapptech as enthusiast mobile developer and intern. Probably it's greatest experience I've ever had with [team](https://andromeda.ge/). I left the company mainly because of time lack.

## Education
Considering my age, I'm school student and I'm in the ninth form. I go to [Komarovi N199 public school](http://komarovi.edu.ge/), which specializes in mathematics and physics. Before Komarovi, I went to Tbilisi's N51 public school.

Also I'm student of Information Technology Center named [Mziuri](http://mziuri.ge/).
