## About me
I'm 14 years old software engineer from Tbilisi,Georgia. I started programming at the age of 9,and I really got great experience and met new people. When I'm not busy,I always attend lectures and tech talks,because I want to learn new things of all areas in technologies. Here's my experience and knowledge so far:

* Pascal - tiny experience. Just basics.

* [C++](https://github.com/getsadzeg/cpp-codes) - 3 years of non-working experience.

* C# - small experience. Created [cnNET](https://github.com/getsadzeg/cnNET) with it.

* [Java](https://github.com/getsadzeg/java-codes) - I collected much experience in the last year, created some small projects.

* Android - My favourite thing. Created two projects on hackathons.

* Git - Using and learning simply everyday, after 2014.

* Web Development - tiny experience. I know HTML & CSS basics.

## Hackathons' experience
I love hackathons more than anything in the world. It's "competition" which helps you to meet new people and learn new,great things. Here's my experience:

* [hack@MACS](http://hackatmacs.devpost.com/) - just attended.
